I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I am interested in using tools from chemistry and biological engineering to build devices for energy harvesting and molecular computing.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are mainly focused on two broad questions: (1) how can we control energy flow at the nanoscale? and (2) how can we integrate organic materials and biology to build devices with emergent properties? I am very interested in understanding why the efficiency of organic-based devices, such as the tiny light-emitting materials that help you read this on your device or the solar panels on your roof that power your home, are not close to their thermodynamic limits and how can we tweak organic materials to bring the efficiency of these organic-based devices close to their thermodynamic limits. My PhD work at the University of Melbourne was aimed to understand how can we build [efficient solar concentrator devices](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00432) through optimizing molecular design of organic emitters. I used optical spectroscopy, which is a fancy way of saying I shoot lasers on my materials, to understand how energy flows in devices and using this knowledge to tweak my materials.

In my postdoctoral work at MIT, I got interested in using DNA, which is basically a molecular fingerprint, as a scaffolding material to mimic photosynthesis in plants. We hypothesized that Nature has gone through a lot of trial-and-error to optimize life and so by mimicking Nature we might get the [key design principles to build efficient devices](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-biophys-052118-115259). I am also interested in how can we use DNA as an alternative computing device. Inspired by how cells keep their stuff from the environment through compartmentalization, we built a scalable way to build the [molecular equivalent of a Google (or Bing if you're into that) search engine](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.936369v2).

My future research program will invovle questions such as: where did the energy go? why did we lose so much energy? is there a way to tweak organic materials to reduce losses and optimize them for specific applications? how can we integrate these devices with biology?, are typical questions that I aim to answer using my multidisciplinary background that spans synthetic chemistry, optical spectroscopy, device physics, and DNA nanotechnology.

Other Interests
======
When I have free time, I volunteer to help students from [resource-limited areas](https://www.facebook.com/pmdorg/photos/a.10155092464273063/10155092464548063/?type=3&theater). I am passionate about [helping graduate students and postdoc peers to be effective leaders in science](http://web.mit.edu/physics/mitleaps/). I'm interested in translating research that I develop in the lab. I'm currently the [Technical Founder of Cache DNA LLC](http://www.cache-dna.com/).
